# tnetennba

A word guessing game built using React. Just like the one on TV, you start by selecting a bunch of vowels and consonants, then try to make the longest word you can. 

The current version is deployed here: [https://akflds.github.io/tnetennba/](https://akflds.github.io/tnetennba/)

Note: I'm currently using a _very_ limited word list. Please don't take it personally if it doesn't recognise one of your guesses. I'm working on a more robust back-end for both this game and [Nigel Plebes](https://github.com/akflds/nigel-plebes).
